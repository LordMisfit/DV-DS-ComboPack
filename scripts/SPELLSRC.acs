// Side dashing / dodging scripts by KeksDose
//
// 23 / June / 2013
//
// This script allows you to double tap your strafing buttons to execute some
// mad side dash. Kinda like the sidestep spring in GoldenEye 007
// and Perfect Dark.
//
// Edit 20 / April / 2014:
//
// Condensed script to 80 character limit, improved some stuff. Dashing on the
// ground is more powerful, air dash adds a little jump. Using the resurrect
// cheat will no longer disable dashing. You can now dash with the turn buttons.
// And the dash sound will no longer play in the whole map. Now works like
// Unreal's dashing.
//
// Reuse and modify these scripts as you wish, just credit me somewhere.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Preprocessor and global constants:

#libdefine SD_TIMEFRAME		8		// Tics during which you must double press
#libdefine SD_DASHDELAY		30		// Tics before being able to dash again
#libdefine SD_DASHSPEED		9.0		// Dash speed whilst in the air
#libdefine SD_DASHJUMP		10.0	// Adds a little z-velocity while in the air
#libdefine SD_DASHSTRONG	20.0	// And dash speed whilst grounded
#libdefine SD_SOUNDVOLUME	1.0		// How loud the dash sound is played
