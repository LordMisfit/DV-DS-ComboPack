// Tip Texts

TXT_GTIP001 = "Tip #1: Remember, your dash ability will let you pass THROUGH projectiles, AND monsters/actors who obstruct your movement. If you get caught in a stationary object after dashing, dash away from it again to get free.";
TXT_GTIP002 = "Tip #2: Dashing lets you move past unalerted monsters if you know where they are (i.e. dashing between two corridors, etc).";
TXT_GTIP003 = "Tip #3: Archviles take 5x Melee damage (and flinch much more often from melee attacks), but 20% Magic damage. Hell Clerics inversely take 5x Magic damage (and flinch much more often from magic attacks), but 20% Melee damage."
TXT_GTIP004 = "Tip #4: Fatally freezing an enemy and shattering them stops Archviles (Doom) and Banshees (Heretic) from being able to resurrect them. It also works on Death Incarnates so they can't SELF-RESURRECT. >:3"
TXT_GTIP005 = "Tip #5: Hell Clerics are extremely dodgey and fast moving, and they can hit you with fast-chained fireballs, including some skull-like ones that can seek, however their TRUE threat is in melee: they are an anti-melee melee unit, taking 20% melee damage, while dishing out tons of it themselves (and meleeing in a 3-hit combo). Magic is best for dealing them, as they take 5x damage from it and stagger from it more often."
TXT_GTIP006 = "Tip #6: Hell Knights have slightly smaller and WEAKER plasma balls than their stronger Baron cousins. Belphegors however have STRONGER plasma balls than Barons, and toss them one after another, three or more per salvo. Avoid their shots as often as possible! D:"
TXT_GTIP007 = "Tip #7: Flora's 'Martial Arts Mastery', and Deggaris/Illucia's 'Berserker Fit' perks also increase their resistance to enemy melee damage, even MORE SO if they are guarding [via their unarmed fist/punch weapons, or also the 'Poison Needle' as Flora]."
TXT_GTIP008 = "Tip #8: A recommended first perk to invest in during longer playthroughs is 'Cleared of Mind'. Though the bonuses it gives seem minute at first, it gives a lot of different TYPES for a single perk [EXP bonus, crit damage dealt, MP costs for spells reduced, HP/MP/Stamina Regen, etc]."
TXT_GTIP009 = "Tip #9: If any enemy has a '?' on their lifebar plate, it means you are looking at/targetting a near-stealth enemy who is almost completely invisible. The 'Night Vision', Light-Amp Goggles, etc, will make them MUCH more visible during their effect, though. These monsters also temporarily become more visible and less transperant while attacking, flinching or dying."
TXT_GTIP010 = "Tip #10: The 'Partial Invisibility Sphere', 'Shadowsphere', 'Shadow Armor' items and any 'Invisiblity' spell will also increase your evasion temporarily by UP TO 33.3%. The bonus is less however the higher your base evasion is before this [i.e. a base evasion of 50% will only get a +16.6% bonus]."
TXT_GTIP011 = "Tip #11: Beware if you see the Diabloist glow PURPLE and see sparkles emitting around you: this means they're about to hit you with a 'Graviton Glare', which will reduce either your (current) health, MP, or BOTH, by a random % [usually ~50-75%]. This move is not fatal, but beware, for this move will affect your INVULNERABLITY TIMER if you're invulnerable, reducing it as well."
TXT_GTIP012 = "Tip #12: Death Incarnates are EXTREMELY resistant to Fire, taking about ~10% the normal amount of damage. Plasma and Electric are 1.5 to 2x more effective, and Holy elemental damage is EIGHTEEN times more effective against them. Flora's Sceptre also does SIX times its normal damage to them."
TXT_GTIP013 = "Tip #13: A majority of characters, all player classes and most human-sized monsters alike, will take at up to EIGHT times the damage from crushers. Be extremely careful if you get caught in an area with crushers, and try to use them against your enemies. Bigger monsters are much less susceptible to this extra crush damage [i.e. Cyberdemons, Masterminds]."
TXT_GTIP014 = "Tip #14: Dashing also negates pretty much ANY form of damage taken, with exception to Drowning. Even damaging and crushing sectors will fail to inflict damage on you while dashing."
TXT_GTIP015 = "Tip #15: All characters can 'quick-kick' while using ANY weapon. The quick kick also shoves back its victim with more force than expected. If a monster is kicked back into another, the second monster might infight with the kicked monster. Kicking a monster into a wall will also deal it some extra damage."
TXT_GTIP016 = "Tip #16: Just HOLDING the Hell Warrior's shield [i.e. having it selected] will reduce damage dealt to you by a small to moderate amount. However using the alt-fire to actively 'block' will further reduce damage AND occasionally reflect projectile attacks (though it will cost stamina to hold the shield to guard). Attacking with the shield also briefly counts as 'blocking' this way for a few moments (but WITHOUT a Stamina penalty, though the ~10 MP cost per shot is its own deterrent from using this too often)."
TXT_GTIP017 = "Tip #17: The more kills you get via the Hell Warrior's Shield, the stronger it grows, however gradual those increases will be. Mind the ~10 MP cost per shot though. The shots also tunnel/rip through most monsters, though are slow."
TXT_GTIP018 = "Tip #18: The Unmaker has TWO ammo types it can use, though not both at once: MP (for all characters), Cells at 3 per laser (for Deggaris/Illucia), and Hellcore Heat (for Flora only). The appropriate perks will apply to the damage based on the ammo-mode used."
TXT_GTIP019 = "Tip #19: Sauron's Gauntlets will drain HP, MP and Stamina and give some to you for each hit you land on enemies. Deggaris and Illucia will also get a small amount of AP as well."
TXT_GTIP020 = "Tip #20: Flora's 'Diaris Longbow' and the Marines' 'Railgun' have multiple zoom modes [2/4/8x] (via the [USER4 key]). Being zoomed in also adds a minor damage modifier, higher for higher zoom modes (though this comes at the cost of a smaller FOV)."
TXT_GTIP021 = "Tip #21: When using your unarmed fist/punch weapon (or Flora using her 'Poison Needle' weapon), the [USER4 key] will put you into a 'guarding' mode, that increases defense and balance (moreso against enemy MELEE attacks depending on the 'Martial Arts Mastery'/'Berserker Fit' perks), boosts HP/Stamina regeneration speed, and will also boost Tension build-up speed. Press [FIRE] or [ALT-FIRE] to leave guarding mode."
TXT_GTIP022 = "Tip #22: Hold down both [USE] and [ZOOM] keys together to build up tension until you reach a stronger level. '5', '20', '50', '100', '250', '500', & '1000' levels of Tension exist, each giving more power than before, but once you attack or use a tension-sensitive healing ability, it will count down, giving you a few seconds to fully take advantage of it."
TXT_GTIP023 = "Tip #23: Outside of the effects of buffs or ailments, HP/Health and Stamina regeneration are also affected by your actions/movements. The best state for regeneration is a combination of crouching while staying in place, and also while using your fists' (or Flora's 'Poison Needle') 'defend' mode (which also speeds up HP/Stamina Regeneration). Actively moving around and attacking will slow down HP/Stamina regeneration, inversely."
TXT_GTIP024 = "Tip #24: '5' Tension is a 1.7x multiplier to damage dealt (and healing spells), +2.5% faster Stamina Regeneration, +3.5% movement speed, and -2.5% damage taken."
TXT_GTIP025 = "Tip #25: '20' Tension is a 3x multiplier to damage dealt (and healing spells), +5% faster Stamina Regeneration, +15% movement speed, and -7.5% damage taken."

TXT_GTIP027 = "Tip #27: '100' Tension is a 7.5x multiplier to damage dealt (and healing spells), +25% faster Stamina Regeneration, +37.5% movement speed, and -30% damage taken."
TXT_GTIP028 = "Tip #28: '250' Tension is a 11.25x multiplier to damage dealt (and healing spells), +50% faster Stamina Regeneration, +56.25% movement speed, and -45% damage taken."
TXT_GTIP029 = "Tip #29: '500' Tension is a 17.5x multiplier to damage dealt (and healing spells), +150% faster Stamina Regeneration, +87.5% movement speed, and -65% damage taken."
TXT_GTIP030 = "Tip #30: '1000' Tension is a 25x multiplier to damage dealt (and healing spells), +400% faster Stamina Regeneration, +125% movement speed, and -90% damage taken."
TXT_GTIP031 = "Tip #31: '250', '500', and '1000' tension are levels exclusive to Aetherius, and have never appeared in any official Dragon Quest titles. '100' is the maximum in the mainline titles."
TXT_GTIP032 = "Tip #32: Higher level Archviles have gained the ability to blast a wave of concussive, piercing fire toward their foes. The higher their level, the stronger the possibility of them doing this."
TXT_GTIP033 = "Tip #33: Beware any very high-leveled Pinky-family monster (with ironically, exception to the Chaingun Blood Pinky), for they will likely gain a medium range fire-breath attack (PinkyBreath) which pierces multiple enemies in their path, and has a fairly high critical hit rate."
TXT_GTIP034 = "Tip #34: Cyberdemons and Cyber-Annihilators also now pack a nasty stomp attack in melee range (even able to switch to using it in IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROCKET SAVLO). Unlike a certain other mod, this stomp, while not an automatic one-hit kill, will still deal a ton of damage to its target, provided they are on the ground. Cyberdemons will sometimes stomp at Cacodemons, Lost Souls and other flying monsters with little to no effect due to them being out of the stomp's low-to-the-ground radius."
TXT_GTIP035 = "Tip #35: Under default mod settings, beware any monster with under 25% of their health (and even more so with under 1% of their health), they have a chance to fire off or perform what is called a 'crisis attack', an attack that is [usually] THIRTY times the strength of their normal attacks, along with a distinct sound playing alongside it. Projectiles of this nature will emit shrinking 'afterimages' of itself like particles behind them. Crisis attacks are also NOT the same as critical hits, as crits can also sometimes occur with a crisis attack as well, which makes them even MORE dangerous."
TXT_GTIP036 = "Tip #36: The 'Poison Cloud' spells will IGNORE the armor of Deggaris and Illucia if they wander into their areas of effect, so beware, or else a possibly quick death or near-death awaits."

TXT_FLORATIP002 = "Flora Tip #2: Flora is EXTREMELY resistant to fall damage [besides instant death sector 'falls']. She takes only 0.5% damage from falls (which usually means NONE whatsoever).";
TXT_FLORATIP003 = "Flora Tip #3: The 'Poison Needle' will insta-kill any enemy that's not a named, unique boss, if you land a critical hit. This even overkills Death Incarnates, so they can't get back up. :V"
TXT_FLORATIP004 = "Flora Tip #4: Hellcore Souls have 'infinite' ammo, but every use of them slowly heats up Flora's soul. If her 'HLCR' meter is above 100%, she will incur damage when using one, higher amounts if her HLCR is higher and higher over 100%. Let it cool down to prevent this, or take a Miracle Potion, as overheating too much CAN be lethal to Flora if you're not careful."
TXT_FLORATIP005 = "Flora Tip #5: If you pick up the 'Ruinous Shield', Hellcore Souls are NOT reduced in the damage they deal to enemies, unlike other attacks, BUT they will incur more HLCR heat on Flora than normal due to the shield's curse."
TXT_FLORATIP006 = "Flora Tip #6: The 'Ruinous Shield', is indeed, cursed. However, Flora's presence will slowly 'uncurse' it over time, at the cost of a temporary series of deteriments to her stats, defense, damage output, and a slow but non-lethal degeneration of HP and MP will occur. If you uncurse the shield fully, it becomes a very good permenant armor item."
TXT_FLORATIP007 = "Flora Tip #7: If you grab the 'Ruinous Shield', take note that the shield will uncurse faster/more-often depending on which of Flora's OTHER armor items you have. The best individual armor piece for dispelling the curse and mitigating its worse effects is the 'Dove's Ribbon'."
TXT_FLORATIP008 = "Flora Tip #8: Flora's dashing cooldown is greatly reduced if you find the 'Safe Tea Shoes' armor piece."
TXT_FLORATIP009 = "Flora Tip #9: Make sure to remember you can use Flora's 'Sceptre of Empyrea' as a shield to block and reflect almost all attacks coming in from front angles [except Railguns]. It consumes a steady 2 MP a second and a bit of stamina to use, but it also puts you in a 'defending' position, so any attack that does hit you will only do ~50% [or LESS] damage.
