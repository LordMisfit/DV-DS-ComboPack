Guide to Stats:

 1. Level
 - Evasion +(0.05% * Level) [+1% per 20 levels] (becomes +(0.07% * Level) [+1.4% per 20 levels] w/ Divine Avatar)
 - [(Level / 25) + (Agility / 10) + (Strength / 16)] = Diaris LongBow Proficiency Level [between 1 and 50, determines movement speed while drawing the bow].
 - Every 50 Levels = +1 HP regeneration per cycle.
 - Level also has a big effect on how much ammo of each type characters can hold. HOWEVER, you must have grabbed enough Backpacks for the full effect of this to apply.
  - Flora: Each Level = +6 Arrow Maximum
  - Deggaris/Illucia/Flora: Each Level = +10/+7.5/+5 Bullet Maximum
  - Deggaris/Illucia: Each Level = +4/+3 Shell Maximum
  - Deggaris/Illucia: Each Level = +2/+1.5 Rocket Maximum
  - Deggaris/Illucia: Each Level = +40/+30 Cell Maximum

 2. HP
 - Simply put, your Health. If it hits 0, you r dedz. :P
 - However, there is a stat known as Death-Resistance, that if it kicks in, even an otherwise fatal hit will leave you with 1 HP.
 - HP very slowly regenerates, and if it's above 100%, it'll degenerate back to that 100% level. (provided that respective option is set [by default it will be])
 - In fact, the quickest way to naturally regenerate HP is to crouch still in place, as it will almost double the regenerative rate. Inversely, moving around or firing weapons will slow down regeneration.
  - Movement Attributes:
    - Standing: 100% of regeneration rate
    - Walking Forward/Back/Left/Right: 40% of regeneration rate
    - Attacking/Alt-Attacking: 40%-60% of regeneration rate
    - Flying Up/Down: 60% of regeneration rate  
    - Jumping: 40% of regeneration rate
    - Crouching: 180% of regeneration rate
 - Up to 1.7x regeneration speed for Flora when she has all the correct armor items [Pearly Corset [+20%], Evenstar Necklace [+10%], Anubis Cufflinks [+15%], & Balrog Ring [+25%]]
 - Flora can naturally regenerate HP up to 200% of the maximum [and null degeneration] when wearing the Dove's Ribbon.
 - 1.5x regeneration speed when under Divine Avatar
 - Every 12 points of Defense = -1 tic [35 tics = 1 second] of HP regeneration wait
 - 1 HP regenerated every cycle [base]
 - Every 50 Levels = +1 HP regeneration per cycle.
 - Every 15 Points of Strength = +1 HP regeneration per cycle.
 - Regeneration Cycles might randomly increase or decrease by 5 tics each time they occur.

 3. Mana
 - Fuels your spells. If you lack the mana, you can't really cast jack. :P
 - HOWEVER. If your Mana is at or above it's 100% maximum, and the spell you want to use would normally cost more than you have, you will still be able to cast that spell ONCE, but it will completely empty out your mana. (More often than not, this only applies to Deggaris due to his naturally low MP reserves versus the other two)
 - Mana will regenerate naturally, but your Sorcery and Thrapeusis stats will help determine how much you regenerate, and your level will determine the speed of regeneration cycles.
 - Mana can also be recovered by punching enemies with Sauron's Gauntlets, grabbing Mana Cubes, grabbing Soul Spheres and grabbing Mega Spheres.
 - Soul Spheres and Mega Spheres can set Mana above 100% [it also does NOT degenerate].
 - [(Sorcery + Therapeusis) / 30] = -1 tic of Mana Regeneration wait
 - [(Sorcery + Therapeusis) / 10] = +1 point of Mana regeneration per cycle
 - [(Sorcery + Therapeusis) / 20] = -1% Mana Costs.

 - 4x when using Divine Avatar
 - 128x when Invulnerable

 11. Jumping
 - Your jumping height in an exact amount [this is also based on adding 24 stepheight, so it's actually more of an indicator of how high of platforms above you that you can climb onto when jumping]
 - This stat cannot be directly increased, it is only increased through methods such as below.
 - Multiple items, your Level, your Agility, etc. Will determine this.
 - 4x when using Divine Avatar.

 12. Evasion
 - In the most technical terms: Evasion is the chance you'll "dodge" an attack that appears to have nailed you dead on. This is done by the "Normal" damage factoring being set to "0.0" at [amount out of 100%] of the time each tic of gameplay.
 - This stat cannot be directly increased, it is only increased through methods such as below.
 - This is normally maxed out at 75% [3/4], but Flora can reach as high as 92.5% [37/40] with the Dove Ribbon equipped.
 - Deggaris: Every Point of Agility = 0.045% Evasion [+0.005% w/ Sauron's Helmet, +0.01% w/ Sauron's Gauntlets, +0.03% w/ The One Ring; Max of +0.090% per point]
 - Deggaris: Every Point of Deftness = 0.00% Evasion [+0.005% w/ Sauron's Helmet, +0.01% w/ Sauron's Gauntlets, +0.03% w/ The One Ring; Max of +0.045% per point]
 - Illucia: Every Point of Agility = 0.050% Evasion [+0.005% w/ Sauron's Helmet, +0.01% w/ Sauron's Gauntlets, +0.03% w/ The One Ring; Max of +0.095% per point]

 - Flora: Every Point of Agility = 0.055% Evasion [+0.005% w/ Sauron's Helmet, +0.01% w/ Sauron's Gauntlets, +0.03% w/ The One Ring; Max of +0.100% per point]
 - Flora: Every Point of Deftness = 0.00% Evasion [+0.005% w/ Sauron's Helmet, +0.01% w/ Sauron's Gauntlets, +0.03% w/ The One Ring; Max of +0.045% per point]
 - 1.75x Normal Value when Divine Avatar is active
 - 1.5x Normal Value when Hasted
 - 0.667x Normal Value when Slowed
 - 0.25x Normal Value if Flora has the Ruinous Shield equipped
 - 1.25x Normal Value if Flora has the Divine Shield equipped
 - Various Armor can slightly alter the rates of this [Flora only]
 - [FUTURE] Various boots can somewhat increase or alter this [Deggaris/Illucia Only]
 - The stat display only shows full percentages, not decimal places.

 13. Death-Resistance
 - Also known as "Last Chance Hit Point", or "Mortal Blow Survivability" or "I Should've Died But I Didn't Somehow O_o"
 - If this kicks in on the same tic that you suffer an otherwise killing blow, you'll be left with 1 HP [no mercy invinciblity (YET) though]
 - This works by setting the player with BUDDHA for that tic if the chance rolls positive. FOILBUDDHA attacks will probably override this though, if any exist. :P
  - Because of the above, you won't be able to permenantly set Buddha mode on yourself [via cheating] as it will be checked on the next tic and likely get cleared.
 - The maximum is normally 87.5% [7/8], but Flora can increase hers to 93.75% [15/16] if she has Kissa's Armored Brasseire equipped.
 - This stat cannot be directly increased, it is only increased through methods such as below.
 - Every 2 Levels = +0.1% Death Resistance
 - Every 3 points of Defense = +0.1% Death Resistance [Very Easy & Easy Skills]
 - Every 4 points of Defense = +0.1% Death Resistance [Normal Skill]
 - Every 5 points of Defense = +0.1% Death Resistance [Hard & Very Hard Skills]
 - Deggaris/Illucia's Armors can increase this by as little as 0.5% [Green Armor] to 17.6% [Divine Diamond Skin]
 - Flora's Armors can increase this by up to 50% [Anubis Cufflinks (+10%), Kissa's Armored Brasseire (+25%) & Dove's Ribbon (+15%)]
 - When Divine Avatar is activated, 1/4 of whatever amount out of 100% you DON'T have is added [i.e. if you have 30%, that leaves 70% uncovered, of which 17.5% of that is added to the initial 30% until Divine Avatar expires, making it 47.5% in this case]
 - If Flora is equipped with the Ruinous Shield, her total Survival Rate is cut by 9/10s until the Shield is uncursed.
 - The Sauron Equipment also Boosts this:
  - Helmet = +17.5%
  - Gauntlets [Deggaris] = +5.0%
  - Gauntlets [Illucia] = +6.0%
  - Gauntlets [Flora] = +4.0%
  - The One Ring = +33.3%
 - The stat display only shows full percentages, not decimal places.

 14. Armor Protection %
 - The basic and most visible indicator of how much damage your armor protects you from.
 - Understand that this is not the OVERALL protection from damage for your character [such as factoring in buffs, Levels, the Defense stat, etc], just what your ARMOR gives you.
 - Deggaris and Illucia's Armor Protection can get to about 98.75%, but their armors are malleable and can be destroyed.
 - Flora's Armor Protection maxes out at 67%, but her armor items are permenant and can't be destroyed, giving her a more stable form of defense with this.
 - The stat display only shows full percentages, not decimal places.

 15. Stamina %:
 - Stamina affects how often you can use melee attacks [besides the Chainsaw & Double-Bladed Chainsaw]. Any exertion-based melee attack applies.
 - Stamina will NOT decrease just from running OR jumping, but doing either WILL reduce the regenerative rate of stamina.
 - In fact, the quickest way to naturally regenerate Stamina is to crouch still in place, as it will greatly increase the regenerative rate. Inversely, moving around or firing weapons will slow down regeneration.
 - This stat has a fixed maximum [100%], so increasing your level, or other stats won't increase it, but it will increase the SPEED/AMOUNT OF REGENERATION.
 - HOWEVER, Stamina can be increased beyond 100% temporarily, though it will quickly degenerate back down to 100%.
 - Various items also restore stamina in addition to the regeneration rates:
  - Health Bonus - Adds 0.5%, up to 500%
  - Stimpack - Adds 5%, up to 100%
  - Medikit - Adds 12.5%, up to 100%
  - SoulSphere - Adds 25%, up to 500%
  - MegaSphere - Adds 50%, up to 500%
  - Berserk Pack - Adds 200%, up to 500%
 - Regeneration:
  - Deggaris: +(0.15 + ((Level / 16) * 0.01))% per tic
  - Illucia: +(0.13 + ((Level / 14) * 0.01))% per tic
  - Flora: +(0.09 + ((Level / 10) * 0.01))% per tic
  - Movement Attributes:
    - Standing: 100% of regeneration rate
    - Walking Forward/Back/Left/Right: 76% of regeneration rate  
    - Flying Up/Down: 84% of regeneration rate  
    - Jumping: 76% of regeneration rate
    - Crouching: 120% of regeneration rate
  - Armor Increases:
   - Deggaris/Illucia's Armors: +1.2% to +15.0% regeneration rate
   - Flora's Armors: up to +37.5% regeneration rate
   - (Sauron's) Helmet / Gauntlets: -10% regeneration rate [each]
  - Stat Effects:
   - Every 16 points of Strength on any character = +1% Stamina regeneration per cycle.
   - For DEGGARIS ONLY, every 16 points of Strength = +1% more Stamina regeneration per cycle.
   - For ILLUCIA ONLY, every 16 points of Defense = +1% more Stamina regeneration per cycle.
   - For FLORA ONLY, every 16 points of Agility = +1% more Stamina regeneration per cycle.
  - Divine Avatar increases Regeneration rate by 1.75x
 - Drain for attacks
  - Stamina drain per punch [no Gauntlets]:
   - Deggaris: ~2.25% per punch
   - Illucia: ~2.5% per punch
   - Flora: ~3.33% per punch 
  - Stamina drain per punch [w/ Gauntlets]:
   - Deggaris: ~5.62% per punch, ~14.05% per alt-fire punch
   - Illucia: ~6.25% per punch, ~15.62% per alt-fire punch
   - Flora: ~8.32% per punch, ~20.81% per alt-fire punch
  - Stamina drain per Sceptre Swing:
   - Normal Use: ~5.75% [Sceptre Level 0] to ~5.03% [Sceptre Level 16]
   - Defensive Shield: ~0.21% per tic [Sceptre Level 0] to ~0.14% per tic [Sceptre Level 16]
   - Spinning Attack: ~10.05% to ~8.55% [Sceptre Level 16]
 - The stat display only shows full percentages, not decimal places.
 - Stamina is also used to fuel Tension Charge.
  - Charge Rates
   - 0 to 5 = 0.2714% Stamina / tic
   - 5 to 20 = 0.2873% Stamina / tic
   - 20 to 50 = 0.3016% Stamina / tic
   - 50 to 100 = 0.3257% Stamina / tic
   - 100 to 250 = 0.3455% Stamina / tic
   - 250 to 500 = 0.3619% Stamina / tic
   - 500 to 1000 = 0.3619% Stamina / tic
  - If your Stamina runs down to 0% before a full charge of Tension occurs, you'll fail to Psyche Up automatically and lose your current charge outright [but you won't lose any already charged up Tension levels].

 16. Heat %:
 - Heat is Flora's Hellcore heating level. Only she can use Hellcore weapons, so Deggaris and Illucia never have to deal with this mechanic.
 - Increases when Hellcore weapons are shot.
  - Sauron's Helmet = 1.34x Hellcore Heating
  - Sauron's Gauntlets = 1.34x Hellcore Heating
  - The One Ring = 0.75x Hellcore Heating
  - Ruinous Shield = 3x Hellcore Heating
  - Flora's Armors = down to 0.335x Heating [with all 11]
 - If heating is above 100%, the initial shot in a volley of attacks [aka the first shot of the Belphegor Fist's triple shot] will inflict a varying amount of damage to Flora based on how much above 100% heating she is. This is able to completely deplete her HP and kill her as well, so be warned.
 - Heating can max out at 1000%.
 - Being invulnerable will allow you to avoid incuring Hellcore damage if above 100%, but you need to keep an eye on the invulnerability timer [especially around Diabloists].
 - Hellcore Heating will cool down naturally over time, but other items can also help reduce it.
  - Health Bonus = -(0.25 + (Level * 0.0025) + random(-0.05,0.05))% Heating
  - SoulSphere = -(25.00 + (Level * 0.25) + random(-5.00,5.00))% Heating
  - MegaSphere = -(75.00 + (Level * 0.75) + random(-15.00,15.00))% Heating
 - 0.04% cooldown per tic.
  - 3x cooldown rate if the Dove Ribbon is equipped
  - 1.5x cooldown rate when under Divine Avatar
  - 16x cooldown rate if ??????? status. [FUTURE... MAYBE? o.O]
 - The stat display only shows full percentages, not decimal places.

 17. Seeds/Fyggs/Other Stat-Increasing Items
 - Seeds generally affect only one stat at a time: HP/Health, MP/Mana, Agility, Defense, Deftness, Sorcery, Strength or Therapeusis. Generally, the increase is by only 1 point, but HP and Mana can be increased by more than one point via their respective seeds [Life for HP, Magic for MP/Mana].
 - The Seed of Skill randomly increases either Agility, Defense, Deftness, Sorcery, Strength or Therapeusis by 1 four seperate times per seed [aka some stats will go up by 1, 0 or even more than 1 point per seed randomly].
 - Most seeds have a hard cap for how many can spawn from enemies. Life and Magic are exempt from this. Additionally, there's two versions of each seed, one with the "Forced" extension, and one without. "Forced" seeds will stay around regardless of the seed limit and can still be grabbed by the player.
 - The Maximum HP Bonus is a much lesser form of the Seed of Life. Under most circumstances [until your HP is at least ~1440 or higher], it will only increase Maximum HP by 1 per bonus. They currently resemble the Heart Tank from the SNES Megaman X games and make a beating sound when you're close.
 - The Fygg is an extremely powerful and divine fruit which increases Agility, Defense, Deftness, Sorcery, Strength and Therapeusis by 16 each.
  - However, only one Fygg can be dropped by monsters throughout an entire playthrough, and they're an EXTREMELY RARE drop. (in DV1/2 modes, more than one can drop on Classic Doom 1/2 modes)
  - In DVII, you can only find and consume one 'naturally spawned' Fygg per 'world'. There are three 'worlds' in DVII: Earth [DV2M01-DV2M05, plus DV2M05S & DV2M07], the Moonbase [DV2M06], and Hell [DV2M08-DV2M10]. DV2M11 also has a Fygg near the start, but there's not much use for it by then since DV2M11 is considered 'post game' or 'bonus content'.
  - Agility/Defense/Deftness/Sorcery/Strength/Therapeusis max out at 512, but can be as low as 0 at the start of a game. 
  - HP & Mana don't techincally have a maximum at the time.
