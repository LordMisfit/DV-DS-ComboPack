The Art of Psyching Yourself Out To Destroy All In Your Way. :P

1. Tension
  - Tension is a state of extra strength brought upon a character by intense focus. It is an element introduced in Dragon Quest VIII and additionally used in DQIX and DQX. It's based on an expanded concept of various abilities from earlier titles in a similar vein of Final Fantasy IV's "Build Up" command for Yang [which sacrifies a turn to make an attack much stronger] if you want a comparison.
  - Due to Akira Toriyama being the design artist for a lot of Dragon Quest's artwork, The concept of incresing Tension is often compared to Dragonball-style powerups, and it's not totally wrong to make a comparison, as some characters will even get into the similar 'bent-down, fists-clenched' kind of pose when charging Tension, also known as the 'Psyche Up' command.
  - The official series has four levels of Tension: "5", "20", "50" and "100". 100 is the maximum and is called "A State of Super High Tension". Usually when "100" Tension is reached, the character will do a scream-like Dragonball powerup and their appearance will slightly change [strands of hair standing up on end; death glares in their eyes, even for characters with normally soft-looking eyes].
  - Aetherius has three ADDITIONAL levels of Tension: "250", "500" and "1000", which are of course even more powerful than "100" is, however the higher the level of Tension you attempt to reach, the longer in-game it takes to 'Psyche Up', the more Stamina it consumes overall [see below], and the higher the chance that the charge up transition fails upon a full charge interval being reached.
  - As mentioned, charging a full "Psyche Meter" doesn't guarantee an increase in your Tension level [except from "0" to "5"], as there's an increasing chance of failing to increase your level. In DQ officially, the only time failure occurs is 50% of the time when trying to jump from "50" to "100" Tension, but in Aetherius, lower level jumps have much lesser but still present failure rates [for some 'balance'] instead of no failure chance at all. [you can set an option to reduce the failure rates of Tension jumps in the Cheats option menu though]
  - When in a Tension level of any kind, in the original series, the Tension will wear off immediately when an ability that uses it [attacking an enemy, healing someone for HP, etc, a parameter-changing buff/debuff skill, etc] is performed. In Aetherius however, due to reasons of the FPS mechanics and ZDoom techinical blather, doing one of these things instead starts a 5.14+ second countdown so that attacks launched from range for example, or multiple attacks against enemies in a short period of time can occur before Tension complete disperses. A light-pink bar represents the timer you have left after attacking the first time when Tension will wear off (and it stays filled prior to an attack/spell using Tension being performed) [this countdown can be sped up or slown down in the Cheats option menu though].
  - Tension Levels and their effects, failure rates to reach the level, etc:
    - "5" Tension = No Failure Rate to reach. Gives 1.7x damage increase, 0.975x damage is taken, 1.035x movement speed. -0.2714% Stamina / tic charge rate.
    - "20" Tension = 2.5% Failure Rate to reach. Gives 3x damage increase, 0.925x damage is taken, 1.15x movement speed. -0.2873% Stamina / tic charge rate.
    - "50" Tension = 10% Failure Rate to reach. Gives 5x damage increase, 0.825x damage is taken, 1.25x movement speed. -0.3016% Stamina / tic charge rate.
    - "100" Tension = 50% Failure Rate to reach. Gives 7.5x damage increase, 0.7x damage is taken, 1.375x movement speed. -0.3257% Stamina / tic charge rate.
    - "250" Tension = 70% Failure Rate to reach. Gives 11.25x damage increase, 0.55x damage is taken, 1.5625x movement speed. -0.3455% Stamina / tic charge rate.
    - "500" Tension = 85% Failure Rate to reach. Gives 17.5x damage increase, 0.35x damage is taken, 1.875x movement speed. -0.3619% Stamina / tic charge rate.
    - "1000" Tension = 95% Failure Rate to reach. Gives 25x damage increase, 0.1x damage is taken, 2.25x movement speed. -0.3619% Stamina / tic charge rate.
  - Though the Tension mechanic is one native to Flora's own series, it is not exclusive to her in Aetherius. Deggaris and Illucia can also 'Psyche Up' their tension, even as high as "1000". This could easily help them get out of a pinch provided they have time to stand still and charge up their Tension.
    - Do keep in mind though: Flora will charge her Tension +33% faster than Deggaris and Illucia [a perk of being native to the same series as the mechanic], and there are also other factors that can affect all characters' charging speeds [besides the Cheat Menu option that governs the charge factor]. Things like Berserk status and Divine Avatar, etc... have varying effects on charge times.
  - Tension shows up on the Hud in the lower-left corner of the screen, to the left of the character's portrait. The level is in a purple/pink eight-point star with the number level of Tension displayed inside. Three bars can also appear to the right of this icon.
    - The darker-purple bar is the "Psyche Up" or "Charge" timer. When charging, it obvious climbs to maximum. When maximum charge is reached, you'll attempt to ascend from one level of Tension to the next one up, but be weary of failure rates, so you might not always ascend upon a filled meter.
    - The light-pink bar represent how much time you have left before your Tension disperses, but it only starts to go down after you perform an action that is fueled by Tension [attacking, a healing spell, a buff/debuff that affect techincal parameters of a target, etc].
    - The smaller red bar represents cooldown. When you move around, a tension-increase fails or succeeds, or Tension wears off, it will appear full. Generally most of these situations gives you a 1-2 second of cooldown [which will drain when standing still (aka not hitting certain keys)], though reverting from a state of Tension will initiate a much larger cooldown duration, and higher Tension levels will make this cooldown even greater. This can be anywhere for 4 to 8 seconds depending on your previous Tension Level. Also, a successful tension jump will give you a somewhat larger than average cooldown rate, but not near the amount as reverting from a state of Tension itself will.
    - The second smaller purplish bar represents "Overpsyche". Basically, a time limit before being in Tension starts dealing you actual damage. Higher levels cause the meter to build faster. When you disperse your Tension completely, this also goes away though.

2. "Psyche Up" Ability.
  - Holding down the "RUN [TOGGLE]" and "USE" keys together [while standing completely still] will cause your character to 'Psyche Up', in an attempt to raise their level of 'Tension'. 
  - A Darker-Purple bar will appear at the upper right corner of your screen, with a eight-pointed star icon [with "0" in it if you have no tension levels, and if you have a Tension level, this star will already be showing]. This is the charge meter. When it hits it's limit, an attempt to increase your Tension one level occurs. [you can increase or decrease the speed of charge up time with the Cheats option menu]
  - Moving around with "STRAFE LEFT/RIGHT" or "MOVE UP/DOWN" or "JUMP" or "CROUCH" will stop a Psyche Up attempt and also drag the charge meter back down to 0 very fast, it also forces a second of 'Cooldown' before you can try to Psyche Up/Charge Tension again. The cooldown bar is a red meter that will drain when you stop moving. Other times cooldown can occur is when reverting from a state of Tension, or success/failure of your Tension to jump from one level to the next after a full charge interval. [you can increase or decrease the speed of cooldown time with the Cheats option menu]
  - As mentioned avove, stamina is consumed [temporarily of course] to fuel a 'Psyche Up' attempt, and higher levels require more stamina per tic to charge towards.
  - Berserk and Divine Avatar actually have a NEGATIVE effect on charge speeds. Berserk reduces charge speed by 25%. Divine Avatar reduces it by 12.5%.
  - However on the flipside, Berserk and Divine Avatar reduce the FAILURE rate of Tension increases, by 12.5% for Berserk, and by 25% for Divine Avatar. These reductions are also direct [so the 50% failure rate of "50" to "100" would become 12.5% if Berserk and Divine Avatar are active at the same time (-37.5% total failure rate)]
