General Guide to Playing as Flora :P

1. Sceptre:

 The sceptre is Flora's iconic and probably most used weapon when playing as her, and because of this, there's a lot of different things it can do. :P

 General Notes:
 - Due to her more mage-oriented and low-HP/Defense nature, it can be VERY risky to engage melee combat via the Sceptre [or even the punch], especially against range-attacking enemies[and EVEN MORESO hitscanners], despite the high damage payout it gives. Be very careful, especially if you're trying to Ironman [aka no-save run] a game as Flora. >.>
 - Like all strength-focused melee weapons, the Sceptre IS affected by the Berserk Pack and the "Enhanced Strength" spell, allowing it to deal 10x it's normal damage.
 - Also like all attacks, Spreader Auras / Spreader Spheres will affect the number of hits each attack emits and the angles they come out at.

 Normal Attack:
 - Pressing FIRE on it's own will prime the sceptre, so you can hold it until the right moment. You can then release FIRE to actually swing it. It'll swing a bit slow at first, and timing the exact frame of the impact is a bit tricky at first, but the average damage is between 275 to 325 (plus the damage from the center of the shockwave it emits [see below]) [before enemies' defenses, etc kick in], so it's an incredibly strong melee weapon.
 - The Sceptre has a very wide hitting arc of about 135 degrees [67.5 to both the left and right side of you], and will hit up to SEVEN enemies in that arc. Really large monsters will soak multiple hits, causing the weapon to be extremely good against Mancubi, Cyberdemons and especially the Spider Mastermind [who will usually soak ALL SEVEN blows if you're right in their face].
 - When the Sceptre impacts anything solid, it'll emit a powerful shockwave which can do some AoE damage to enemies (additionally, it ignores AoE immunity on Cyberdemons/Spider Masterminds/other monsters). It's equal to about [base-damage / 6] at the center, and diminishes over time. The radius of the shockwave is dependant on your Strength stat and also if you're in Berserk mode. Needless to say, Berserk = really good (dare I say, broken) Shockwave radius. :P
 - Whenever the Sceptre is swung [whether it hits something or not], you'll accquire 1-2 Sceptre-specfic EXP. The Sceptre has 17 different levels, from 0 to 16. You can use the cheat options to set the initial level to one other than 0 though at the start of a new game.
 - Hitting enemies with the sceptre will give it extra EXP based on ( 1+(EnemyMaxHP/300) ) for a kill, or 1/3 that much if the hit doesn't kill them.
 - Swinging the Sceptre will deplete some Stamina from Flora [about 5-6%]. Stamina does regenerate, but generally not fast enough [at first] to offset the drain, so continuous swinging will eventually drain you to the point you'll be forced to wait a few moments to swing it again.
 - The higher level the sceptre gets, the faster it swings, the more damage it can do, and the more range it reaches out, and drains less stamina per swing.
 - Also, you can time your swings to guard or even sometimes DEFLECT incoming projectiles/other attacks. It can even block hitscan bullets if they're not too spread out. However the guard only activates on the same frame that the damage to enemies would occur.

 Defensive Shield:
 - Pressing ALT-FIRE will allow Flora to magically spin the sceptre with her Mana [starting at -2 Mana every 0.75 seconds] and a minute amount of Stamina acting as 'fuel'.
 - The Sceptre will appear floating in front of the player, spinning around like a shield. The shield mode will block and deflect a majority of attacks from the front 100-110 degrees. It doesn't guard you from behind or straight from the sides though, so beware.
 - To keep in perspective, even really powerful projectiles like Rockets from Cyberdemons and BFG9000 shots can be blocked or bounced away [the latter perferrably bounced due to it's tracers]. However a few rare attacks [like the Rail-Arachnotron's Railgun shot] can travel through it and hit you.
 - However, even though you can't fully guard from all attacks or from all angles, being in "Defense" mode will also put Flora herself into a defensive mode where damage she DOES incur is reduced. The damage reduction will improve as the Sceptre's level increases].
 - The Mana and Stamina drain for this mode also diminish with each Sceptre Level increased.

 Spinning Attack:
 - Once Flora hits Level 8+ and the Sceptre's Level reaches 2+, Flora can perform a 360-degree spinning attack by pressing down STRAFE-LEFT + STRAFE-RIGHT + FIRE at the same time.
 - Flora will spin in one full 360-degree circle and hit enemies up to 60 times in a full revolution. Each hit does 1/8 the damage of a direct Sceptre strike, but if surrounded by enemies or in other modes of distress, it can cause a ton of havoc. You can even spin in mid-air or during a dash.
 - The direction of the hits is determined by your look angle though, so if you're looking at the ground, you'll notice a lot of the hits from the spin will probably hit the ground in a very tightly knit radius.
 - The spin attack also can block/deflect some attacks if you swing the sceptre through projectiles at the right distances.
 - The attack does require about 2x the Stamina of a normal swing to execute.
 - Flora also gains a defensive bonus while spinning, although not to the same degree as the Defensive Shield mode.


2. Diaris Longbow:

 The Diaris Longbow is a Holy-Elemental longbow that in essence can be compared as a magicial Sniper Rifle. Arrows move at very high speeds and are not affected by gravity [no 'Arc' in Archery :P], and if well timed, even extremely long-distance targets will get wrecked. Most of Flora's enemies in Doom are unholy demons, so the bow is even more effective than it would be expected.

 General Notes:
 - The arrows will pierce all targets in their path, and they only stop when they hit a solid surface. No monster is immune to being ripped through by them.
 - Hades-type monsters (Death Incarnates, Hades Elementals, Hades Overlords, Hades Spheres) are even more vulnerable to this weapon than other Hellspawn, taking a collosal SIX times the amount of damage other enemies do. If you're in a bind from these enemies, an arrow is probably a worthy cost than losing your life or a ton of health/other resources.
 - At random, arrows will do 2x or 3x their base damage. This is totally random though and it's impossible to tell from the appearance of an arrow what strength level it is.
 - The longbow can be aimed by -holding down- the FIRE key. Releasing it will then launch the arrow.
 - To UNaim an arrow without shooting it, hit ALT-FIRE while still holding FIRE down, then release FIRE before the unaiming animation finishes, else you'll reaim the arrow again. :P
 - The Longbow has a random chance to spawn when a normal Doom weapon would otherwise spawn, so they can drop sometimes from zombies, or just places where you'd find weapons as Deggaris and Illucia.
 - Arrows for the longbow work the same way, but with normal Doom ammo instead of weapons. They come in sets of 6, or quivers of 30.
 - Keep in mind that you will slow down when aiming a primed arrow, although the degree you'll slow down is based on multiple factors, and over time you'll be slown down less as you level up and grow stronger.
 - [(Level / 25) + (Agility / 10) + (Strength / 16)] = Diaris LongBow Proficiency Level [between 1 and 50, determines movement speed while drawing the bow].
 - Hitting <USER STATE 3> will alter the Zoom FOV to make it easier to see distant targets. If you are still zoomed in, unarming the bow will put your FOV back, but save the zoomed in FOV for the next time to you switch to the LongBow.


3. Hellcore Weapons/Souls:

 Hellcore magic/weapons/souls represent the force of magic dominately wielded against Flora, Deggaris, Illucia or any other enemies of the Hellspawn.

 General Notes:
 - It's the general umbrella term for the energy used to make Imp Fireballs, Baron Plasmaballs, Cacodemon Gasballs, etc.
 - Unnatural attacks like Cyberdemon Rockets, Mancubi Flame Shots, Arachnotron Plasma, etc. are generally a technological form of attack, and thus don't apply as Hellcore.
 - Hellcore magic doesn't have an ammo or mana 'limit', however it cannot be wielded without some form of side-effects by non Hellspawn. 
 - Such invokers will generally incur an event known as "Hellish Heating of the Soul". Depending on the attack emulated by the user, their soul will temporarily heat up by a certain degree, represented by a meter marked 'HLCR' in the lower left corner.
 - If the HLCR% goes above 100%, Flora will start to take some damage when attacking with Hellcore magic. The higher the heating level [above 100% only], the more damage this deals her per attack, to the point it will eventually just outright KILL her if she doesn't stop it for a while.
 - Invulnerability will block the damage otherwise inflicted by using Hellcore magic while 'overheated', but once it wears off, it's best to stop and let your heating cooldown.
 - Hellcore Heating can max out at 1000%.
 - Hellcore automatically cools down on it's own, but there are multiple items that also accelerate or bump cooldowns along. Health Bonuses, Soul Spheres, Mega Spheres and some other forms of healing can do this.
 - Some of Flora's unique armor items also speed up the cooldown process for Hellcore, while others might even reduce the amount of damage she suffers while overheated. Make sure to check your armor stats [with the properly binded key] to see what armor items of her do what. :P
 - There is also a perk specfic for affecting Hellcore souls, from their damage, to attack speed, to cooldown speed, etc.
 - There are 15 Hellcore weapons. Currently they are supposed to be represented by a specfic monster's limbs or eyes or natural piece of their body, although this might be turned into a more 'Soul'-like system similar to how Aria/Dawn of Sorrow's system works instead of using body pieces as catalysts.
 - Each of the Hellcore weapons have 8 levels of power, which are increased by collecting more of the same Soul/Body-piece. This goes from level 1 to level 8. The levels of power solely affect damage output.
 - Remember how monsters can perform 'crisis' attacks when below 25% of their health? Well, Flora can do the same thing using Hellcore magic when HER health is below 25% [and especially when her health is in critical]. Just note the KIND of crisis attack she shoots will also be affected by the respective option in the DV-DS options menus.
 - Keep note a few Hellcore weapons have multiple types of attacks [i.e. the Bruiser Demon's fist, or the Diabloist's Hand, etc]. When this is the case, pressing ALT-FIRE will cycle through them, and FIRE will shoot the currently selected attack.
